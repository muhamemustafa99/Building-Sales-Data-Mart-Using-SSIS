# SSIS ETL Project with Power BI Dashboard

## Overview
This repository contains an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) project implemented using SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS). The project processes data from various sources to populate a data warehouse with dimensional models, including fact and dimension tables.

## Project Structure
- **fact_sales_Full.dtsx**: Full load process for the sales fact table.
- **fact_sales_Incremental.dtsx**: Incremental load process for the sales fact table.
- **dim_date.dtsx**: ETL process for the date dimension table.
- **dim_customer.dtsx**: ETL process for the customer dimension table.
- **dim_product.dtsx**: ETL process for the product dimension table.
- **dim_territory.dtsx**: ETL process for the territory dimension table.
  
## Power BI Dashboard
-Includes visualizations such as Sales by Year, Total Quantity by City, Total Sales by Country, Quantity by Year, and Sales by Top 20 Customers.
-Features KPIs for total sales, sales order IDs, quantity, products, cities, and customers.
-Supports interactive filters for Category, SubCat, Prod_Name, Countries, and City.

## Features
- Extracts data from source tables (e.g., SalesOrderHeader, SalesOrderDetail).
- Applies transformations such as merging, lookups, and calculations (e.g., extended sales and cost).
- Handles slowly changing dimensions (SCD) for customer and product data.
- Manages full and incremental data loads.
- Updates the last load date for tracking purposes.
